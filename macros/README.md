# Door Macros
*Procedural Macros for the `doors` crate*

This crate provides macros that make it easier to work with the
[illumos][1] [Doors API][2] in Rust. These macros are not usable or
useful on their own; check out the [`doors`][3] crate instead -- it
re-exports these macros, and the types they depend on.
